# 1.0.0
- Initial release. The procedures added since moving from my main plugin include:
  - Parse [string] to UUID
  - Default UUID (UUID(0, 0))
  - Random UUID
  - Set UUID of [entity] to [uuid]
  - UUID from most [number1] least [number2]
- Additionally, you can now use UUID as a local + Global session variables. Others may be added... once I figure out how to manage that for 1.21.8
